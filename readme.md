### Problem:
- [ ] Users can enter a country's name and get back the key statistics about the country
- [ ] If the country has some statistics, they should see some kind of graph and charts.
- [ ] They can save their favorite countries

[ 1. Mockup ] -> 
[ 2. Discovery ?? How to solve the frontend & how to backend] -> 
[3. Sketching out code]

### 2a. Frontend ?? How??
- HTML, CSS(Frameworks -- HTML + TW/Daisy)
- JS (Vanilla JS + ???)

### 2b. Backend ?? How??
- an API ?? <--- [..]
- Building it yourself â€” [x]

### 3. ( JS part of the eq)
### 1. Users can enter a country's name and get back the key statistics about the country
 - [ ] Create my `index.html` 
 - [ ] Add tailwind and DaisyUI
 - [ ] Build by search box 
 - [ ] Test API in `app.js` using `fetch()`/`then()`
 - [ ] refactor my API fetch using `async`/`await` functions to keep my code cleaner
 - [ ] Test that I can search for states with my API
 - [ ] Deploy to vercel

### 2. If the country has some statistics, they should see some kind of graph and charts.
- [ ] Discover a library for charts/graphs for my code
- [ ] Use library XXXXXX to show the chart for the searched state's statistics
- [ ] Test that my graph and charts works as expected
- [ ] Deploy to vercel

### 3. They [Users] can save their favorite countries
- [ ] Allow users to save their save in our "local" Database via `localStorage()`
- [ ] Test that favorites saves as expected
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel
